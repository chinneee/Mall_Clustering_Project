# Customer Clustering Using K-Means Algorithms
## Problem Statement
You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

## Data Source
You can access and download data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) or get it from me.
The data includes the following features:

    1. Customer ID

    2. Customer Gender

    3. Customer Age

    4. Annual Income of the customer (in Thousand Dollars)

    5. Spending score of the customer (based on customer behaviour and spending nature)
## Clustering 
Clustering based on 2 features: annual income and spending score.
'Spending and Income Cluster' is the label of data:

We can clearly see that 5 different clusters have been formed from the data. The red cluster is the customers with the least income and least spending score, similarly, the blue cluster is the customers with the most income and most spending score.

So, we used K-Means clustering to understand customer data. K-Means is a good clustering algorithm. Almost all the clusters have similar density. It is also fast and efficient in terms of computational cost.
